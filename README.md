# ToDoList

The given code is a to-do list application written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add tasks, mark them as complete, edit them, and delete them. The HTML structure consists of two main divs, one for the header and one for the to-do list, each containing different elements, such as input fields, buttons, and lists. The CSS file defines the styles for these elements, including the font and color schemes. The JavaScript code handles the application's logic, such as adding new tasks, creating toolbars for each task, and editing and deleting tasks. The code uses event listeners to listen for user actions such as clicks and keypresses and then updates the UI accordingly.
